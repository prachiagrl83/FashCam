# Temp
Temporary folder for final project

Use attached new_dataset as .csv file and for images refer all from https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset

I took 3000 images for analysis as my system was very slow yesterday..now, we can take all rows around 4700.

Tried with around 4700 images and found more than 80% accuracy as result.
